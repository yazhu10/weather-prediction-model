ðŸŒ¦ Weather Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning-based weather prediction system focused on precipitation forecasting. The project leverages historical weather data and applies data science techniques to improve forecast accuracy.

Key Contributions:
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies in historical weather datasets.
Built an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to model and predict precipitation levels, enhancing the systemâ€™s responsiveness to temporal patterns.
Applied DBSCAN clustering to detect and analyze abnormal weather events and regional precipitation groupings.
Compared model performance against traditional baseline methods, achieving an 18% reduction in prediction error.
This model can support climate research, agricultural planning, and disaster preparedness by providing more reliable short- to mid-term precipitation forecasts.
